# Alpaca Identification
This project is all about image classification by using the deep neural network (DNN) or also known as Deep Learning by using framework TensorFlow. Python is used as a programming language because it comes together with TensorFlow framework. The input data mainly focuses in flowers category which there are five (5) types of flowers that have been used in this paper. Deep neural network (DNN) has been choosing as the best option for the training process because it produced a high percentage of accuracy. Results are discussed in terms of the accuracy of the image classification in percentage. Here we are going to use Alpaca Images for creating the classification model which will identify the images of Alpaca from the user input.

## Dataset
The dataset which is used here, is collected from Kaggle website. Here is the link of the dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/sid4sal/alpaca-dataset-small.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to make a identification cum classification model using deep neural networks, which will identify the images of Alpaca from the user given input.

**********************************
## Conclusion
* Images classification is one of the hot topics in today's world.
* Usage of Concolution Neural Network in this type of classification works makes the developer easier to develope models using the architectures.
* For this project we have used the ***EfficientNet B3 Architecture*** to develop the model.
* ***EfficientNet B3 Architecture*** is having the accuracy of 0.93, with macro average of 0.94 and weighted average of 0.92.
* Hence, from my side, this is the best model to be deployed using this dataset, to identify the Alpaca images by the user given input.
